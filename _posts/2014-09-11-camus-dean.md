The illustrations adorning Five Dials 30 came to us via a circuitous route. They were spray-painted on walls and tunnels and bits of concrete in Paris by a collective of Algerian-French artists known as the Zoo Project. Antonio de Luca, who takes over as Five Dials art director in this issue, lives for most of the year in Berlin, but while visiting Paris not too long ago he spent time in a cafe called Chez Jeannette in the 9th and began to notice the surrounding graffiti. ‘The 9th is primarily an area of French-speaking immigrants,’ he says, ‘including many from north-west Africa. The 18th is the same. I remember seeing Zoo Project murals in those areas and figured they were done by those of Algerian descent.’

He researched online and came across more of their work. The collective is mysterious; photos of new work only occasionally spring up. For de Luca, the patterns, the giant bird heads, the repetition of symbols, the ratio between figures and surface area all resemble ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic gods, both hieratic and demotic. He was drawn to what he calls ‘the cannibalistic narratives’ of the pieces, as well as the strong graphic line of the work. ‘Only later,’ he says, ‘did I understand that the pieces were social commentaries.’

Years ago, while working at The Walrus magazine as its first creative director, de Luca isolated graffiti from the walls of other cities. This time he collected photo­graphs of Zoo Project murals that complemented the themes of the three pieces in our issue: reportage by Curtis Gillespie from the streets of Algiers; an A-Z of the death drive written by the novelist Deborah Levy; and some reflections on summer in Algiers by Camus himself.
 
De Luca digitally erased the creeping vines and cracked concrete of the surrounding Parisian landscape. ‘I then began to isolate the line work from its surface and the surrounding context. In a sense,’ he says, ‘it’s like restoring a mural.’ Street art is always being transformed, erased, reshaped. Through photography, some of the Zoo Project murals have been preserved. In some cases he needed two or three photos of the same piece to restore the image. ‘I skewed,’ says de Luca. ‘I distorted, rotated, scaled, warped, merged and modified the aspect ratio to achieve an even surface. I wanted to make it look like the reader was standing dead centre, staring straight on.’

If we’re welcoming a new art director, we also must take a moment to celebrate our outgoing friend and colleague, Dean Allen, who was here from the beginning and guided us through the first 29 issues, often making last-minute changes from the various high-speed trains of southern France. He made the final changes to our Paris issue while sitting at the Le Petit Chatelet on rue de la Bûcherie, steps away from Shakespeare and Company, while our copy-editor, Ellie, sat to his left with her red pen and told him to delete and close up. We finished in time for the launch, though Dean’s laptop almost knocked the wine glass from the table. He was there in Cornwall when we launched an issue as the sun set behind the Five Dials stage at the Port Eliot Festival. (Laetitia Sadier pressed the button of his laptop.) He is responsible for the sparse white glow of the magazine, and because Dean is a text aficionado, he ensured the blocks of words on each page were always beautifully weighted. He is a book guy, but he’s also a tech guy, and we wish him all the best as he throws himself back into that particular world. Great advancements can come from small towns in France. 

Over the years, Dean has been one of our stronger French connections. We have another. With this issue we’ve been given the chance to celebrate our French hero, Albert Camus. The pressing question over the last few months has been: how? What’s left to be said about his centenary? Robert Zaretsky focused on Camus’s relationship with his mother in his essay in the LA Review of Books. In the Times Higher Education section, Matthew Feldman reminded us ‘he should be remembered as a leading twentieth-century intellectual, not simply humanism’s favourite quote generator.’ Over on Public Radio International, Claire Messud said he was ‘beautifully idealistic and painfully out of touch with his times.’ There was praise in some places, anger in others, and also idiocy. (In our research we came across the dissatisfaction of an Amazon one-star review: ‘They sent me the wrong book,’ the customer complained, and then admonished the company: ‘It was The Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers, instead of The Stranger. It was disappointing!!’)

Then, one day, out of the blue, we were sent a piece of reportage from Curtis Gillespie, a Canadian writer who has investigated everything from national politics to environmental policy in that frozen country, and who decided recently to travel from Edmonton to sunny Algiers to investigate the legacy of Camus. ‘I thought I’d be able to manoevre my way around just as I’d navigated other complicated places,’ he told us. ‘Moscow, Guatemala, Sofia, Riga, Cartagena. I’d dive in and make it happen. But Algiers was different, and I was naive to think it would be straightforward. Without my translator, Ben Ali, I’d have been lost. No one spoke English and even my rudimentary French didn’t always work because it’s mostly the older people who speak French. It’s the same principle by which Camus is being erased; erase the French influence.’ Gillespie realized the city was a maze built on a maze overlaid with endless construction and no traffic laws. In a city of five million, where everyone seemed to own a car, he did not see a traffic light. ‘Maybe,’ he says. ‘I just missed them.’ 

What struck Gillespie was the gap between expectation and reality, the plain physical state of the city. He expected chaos. ‘But I suppose I was expecting a city where the chaos and differentness is exciting. In Algiers it was heartbreaking, possibly because I’d pre-romanticized it through Camus’s influence on me. The Casbah is a UNESCO world heritage site, but it’s tragic what’s happening there.

I don’t just mean garbage falling out of tins and so on. I mean heaps and heaps and mounds of stinking, steaming, rotting trash strewn all over the place.’ It wasn’t that different at Tipasa, the Roman ruin. ‘I saw 2,200-year-old tile flooring, that people had clearly recently ripped chunks off of,’ says Gillespie. ‘Anyone could walk right over it. There have been very few places I’ve ever been where the tragic history of a country is so obviously felt on the street, like that history is a shattered window every Algerian has to view their own day through. And the current deg­radation of the place is even harder to witness because through it all you can still see the beauty of the land and the people.’

He had undertaken the journey to ask a question: if Camus is so important, why then, is his work and legacy, and even his name, inciting factionalism in France and facing outright erasure in Algeria, and what does this mean for the rest of the world amidst a fading Arab Spring? Would this piece, he asked us, fit in Five Dials? We paused a moment for dramatic effect. Yes, we replied. 

Alongside it you’ll find Deborah Levy’s alphabetical exploration of the death drive, which features Camus, and we even unearthed a letter, written by the man himself, to our founder, Hamish ‘Jamie’ Hamilton, in 1956. ‘Croyez,’ he signs off in his jagged hand, ‘cher monsieur, a mes sentiments les meilleurs.’
