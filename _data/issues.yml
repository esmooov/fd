      - "Albert Camus was born in Mondovi, Algeria, in 1913. An avid sportsman, Camus claimed to have learned all he knew about morality and the obligations of men from football. He preferred to write whilst standing up and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. While on a trip to the United States, Camus visited the New York Zoo twenty times. He was also the owner of a cat called Cigarette."
      
      - "Curtis Gillespie is the author of five books, including the memoirs Almost There and Playing Through, and the novel Crown Shyness. Gillespie has won three National Magazine Awards in Canada for his writing on politics, science and the arts. In 2010 he co-founded the award-winning narrative journalism magazine Eighteen Bridges, which he also edits. Like Camus, he was a football goalkeeper. He played for the University of Alberta in the early eighties."
